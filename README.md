# Indian COVID Analysis 
# Introduction 
COVID-19 is the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. It usually spreads between people in close contact.
COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against severe illness and death. Although a person can still get COVID-19 after vaccination, they are more likely to have mild or no symptoms. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die.
People over age 60 and those with existing medical conditions have a higher risk of getting seriously ill. These conditions include high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, immunosuppression including HIV, cancer, and pregnancy. Unvaccinated people also have a higher risk of severe symptoms. 

# Documentation
This project therefore vividly examines the Indian COVID-19 data, explores it, and draws insights on the highly attacked age in the country, death rate, most affected group, number of administered vaccinations, effects on the economy worldwide, and possible means to control the situation. 

# Data collection & transformation 
The data was downloaded from the WHO site, imported into Excel cleaned saved as .csv, and imported into the created database in Postgres SQL for queryin. Also, returned results were saved, after which they were imported into the Power BI For Report dashboard design.
